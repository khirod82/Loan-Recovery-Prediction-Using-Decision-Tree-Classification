### Project Title
**Loan Recovery Prediction Using Decision Tree Classification**

### Project Description
The "Loan Recovery Prediction" project involves developing a predictive model to determine the likelihood of loan recovery using a decision tree classification algorithm. The goal is to assist financial institutions in identifying potential loan defaults and optimizing recovery strategies.

The dataset used in this project includes various features such as customer age, credit history length, historical defaults, loan interest rates, loan grade, customer income, home ownership status, loan amount, employment duration, loan intent, and loan term years. The data was split into training, validation, and test sets to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the model.

Key performance metrics of the decision tree model include:
- **Validation Accuracy:** 0.889
- **Test Accuracy:** 0.902
- **Precision:** 0.903 (Average)
- **Recall:** 0.902 (Average)
- **F1 Score:** 0.902 (Average)
- **Area Under Curve (AUC):** 0.903

The project also features a confusion matrix to evaluate model performance, and an analysis of feature importance to understand the impact of each variable on the prediction outcomes. The top contributing features include customer age, credit history length, historical default, and loan interest rate.
The decision tree model's visualization, ROC curves, and Andrews curves plot provide further insights into the model's decision-making process and its ability to distinguish between default and no-default cases.
This project is pivotal for financial institutions aiming to minimize risk and enhance their loan recovery processes by leveraging data-driven insights.
